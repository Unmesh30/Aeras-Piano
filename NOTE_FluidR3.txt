📁 How to Setup:
1. Download FluidR3_GM Soundfont from the given link, a zip file will be downloaded.
2. Unzip the zip file — it will automatically create a folder named `FluidR3_GM` containing:
   - FluidR3_GM.sf2
   - README.txt
   - copyright.txt

3. Place the **entire `FluidR3_GM` folder** inside your `Aéras_Piano` project directory (at the same level as air_piano.py).

📌 Example path used in air_piano.py:
    FluidR3_GM/FluidR3_GM.sf2

🛠️ If you relocate the SoundFont, update this path in your code:
    sf2_path = "/absolute/or/relative/path/to/FluidR3_GM.sf2"

📍 Tip:
If FluidSynth fails to load the SoundFont, check for:
- Correct file path
- Correct file name (`FluidR3_GM.sf2`)
- Matching extension

🎶 You're ready to play!
